# Bird_classification_model

Using the Bird Species dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species), to reduce computing time, we selected the 15 species that had the most training images and used them to train a Neural Networks that could identify the species, which we did with 92% accuracy.
